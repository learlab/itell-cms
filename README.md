# üöÄ iTELL Content Management System

This repository contains a Content Management System (CMS) for iTELL, built from Strapi. It includes several custom or modified plugins in ./src/plugins. Each plugin has been added to the top-level `package.json`, so all `npm` commands may be run from the top-level directory. We are using `npm` for development and deployment.
